# Webpack & Angular — host template

Starter template for the [MFE Orchestrator](https://github.com/mfe-orchestrator), listed in the
marketplace as `webpack-host-angular`. Webpack 5 + Angular 21, wired as a **host**.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20 or newer
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) 10 or newer

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `pnpm install` currently fails with a 404 on `@mfe-orchestrator/client`: the client SDK is not
> published to a registry yet. That single dependency is the only thing missing — everything
> else in this template installs and builds. Until it is published, either wait for it or point
> the dependency at a local checkout of the SDK.

## Getting started

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev        # http://localhost:3000
pnpm build      # production build into dist/
```

## How the orchestrator is wired in

**The host never decides which version it gets.** It hands over the identities it holds and uses
the URL it receives, verbatim. Which version that URL points at — stable, canary, whatever — is
decided by the backend. Nothing in this repo parses a version, builds a URL by hand, or knows that
canaries exist.

Two pieces make that work.

**1. `configure()`, at the very top of the entry point (`src/index.ts`), synchronously, before
anything imports a remote:**

```ts
import { configure } from '@mfe-orchestrator/client';

// MFE_ENV is injected by DefinePlugin, see webpack.config.js
configure(MFE_ENV);
```

**2. The remote, declared in `webpack.config.js` as a promise that resolves to a URL:**

```js
new ModuleFederationPlugin({
  name: 'host',
  filename: 'remoteEntry.js',
  exposes: { './App': './src/...' },
  remotes: {
    exampleremote: `promise import('@mfe-orchestrator/client').then(m => m.remoteUrl('example-remote'))`,
  },
  shared: { ... },
})
```

`remoteUrl('example-remote')` takes the **slug** of a microfrontend and returns the URL the backend
resolved for it, already pinned to a version. Rename the key and the slug to match your own
microfrontends, and add one entry per remote.

The SDK also exposes `manifest()`, `globalVariables()` and `identities()`, all used in this
template, so you can see what the environment actually returned.

## Environment variables

Read from the shell at build time and injected by webpack's `DefinePlugin`. See `.env.example`.

| variable | what it is |
| --- | --- |
| `MFE_BACKEND_URL` | orchestrator backend, including the `/api` suffix |
| `MFE_PROJECT_ID` | id of your project in the orchestrator |
| `MFE_ENVIRONMENT` | environment slug, ex. `DEV` |

```bash
MFE_PROJECT_ID=abc123 MFE_ENVIRONMENT=DEV pnpm build
```

`.env` is gitignored. Never commit real values.

## Build output

`pnpm build` writes to `dist/`. The federation entry lands at **`dist/remoteEntry.js`**.

The marketplace entry for this template declares no `entryPoint`; the whole `dist/` folder is what gets uploaded.

Check it after any change to `webpack.config.js`: the orchestrator serves exactly that path, so a build that
puts the entry somewhere else is broken.

## Deploying

### Upload to the orchestrator

`.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml` builds the app and uploads `dist/` with
[`mfe-orchestrator/github-action`](https://github.com/mfe-orchestrator/github-action). It runs on
any pushed tag, or manually via *Run workflow*.

Configure these once, in the repository settings:

| kind | name | value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| secret | `MICROFRONTEND_ORCHESTRATOR_API_KEY` | your orchestrator API key |
| variable | `MICROFRONTEND_SLUG` | the slug of this host in the orchestrator |
| variable | `ORCHESTRATOR_DOMAIN` | your console URL, optional, defaults to `https://console.mfe-orchestrator.dev` |

The API key is a **secret**, never a variable and never a literal in the workflow file. If you
prefer hardcoding the two per project values instead of using repository variables, replace the
expressions in the `env:` block at the top of the workflow.

### Standalone deploy

A host is consumable as a remote, but it is also an application in its own right, so the same
workflow builds and pushes an nginx image to `ghcr.io/<owner>/<repo>`. `nginx/no-cache.conf` serves
`index.html` for any route and marks the entry files as never cacheable, so a redeploy is picked up
immediately.

```bash
docker build -t my-host .
docker run -p 8080:80 my-host
```

## Notes

- Angular is compiled ahead of time by `AngularWebpackPlugin` from `@ngtools/webpack` — the same compiler the Angular CLI drives, wired into a plain webpack config. There is no `angular.json` and no CLI builder here.
- `configure()` runs in `src/index.ts`, before the `import('./bootstrap')` that starts the app. Keep that order: the federation runtime imports the SDK to resolve a remote and expects it already configured.
- Remote modules are invisible to the compiler. Declare each one you import in `src/globals.d.ts`.
- `output.publicPath` stays `'auto'`. A classic script derives the base of its chunks from `document.currentScript.src`, which is the URL *before* any redirect, so this is what keeps a version pinned entry loading its own chunks instead of mixing two builds in one page.
